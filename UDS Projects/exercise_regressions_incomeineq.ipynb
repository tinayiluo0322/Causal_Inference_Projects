    "In this exercise we'll use data from the 2018 US Current Population Survey (CPS) to try and estimate the effect of being a woman on workplace compensation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that our focus will be *only* on differential compensation in the work place, and as a result it is important to bear in mind that our estimates are not estimates of *all* forms of gender discrimination. For example, these analyses will not account for things like gender discrimination in terms of *getting* jobs. We'll discuss this in more detail below."

The file is called `morg18.dta` and is a Stata dataset.

In this context, for example, we can add fixed effects for the industry of each respondent—since wages often vary across industries, controlling for industry is likely to improve our estimates. Use `ind02` to control for industry.\n",

Our coefficient on `female`, in other words, now tells us how much less (on average) we would expect a woman to be paid than a man *within the same industry*, not across all respondents. \n",
