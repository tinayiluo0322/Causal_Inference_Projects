    "## Matching Packages: Python v. R\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as the best tools for machine learning tend to be in Python since they're developed by CS people (who prefer Python), most of the best tools for causal inference are implemented in R since innovation in causal inference tends to be lead by social scientists using R. As a result, the most well developed matching package is called [MatchIt](https://kosukeimai.github.io/MatchIt/index.html), and is only available in R (though you can always call it from Python using `rpy2`). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the last couple years, though, a group of computer scientists and statisticians here at Duke have made some great advancements in matching (especially the computational side of things), and they recently released a set of matching packages in both R and Python that we'll be using today. They have some great algorithms we'll use today, but be aware these packages aren't as mature, and aren't general purpose packages yet. So if you ever get deep into matching, be aware you will probably still want to make at least partial use of the R package [MatchIt](https://kosukeimai.github.io/MatchIt/index.html), as well as some other R packages for new innovative techniques (like [Matching Frontier estimation](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/frontier/home)), or [Adaptive Hyper-Box Matching](https://almost-matching-exactly.github.io/AHB-R-package/). \n",

    "## Installing dame-flame. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this lesson, begin by installing `dame-flame` with `pip install dame-flame` (it's not on conda yet). \n",
    "\n",
    "[DAME](https://almost-matching-exactly.github.io/DAME-FLAME-Python-Package) is an algorithm that we can use for a version of coarse exact matching. The package only accepts a list of categorical variables, and then attempts to match pairs that match exactly on those variables. That means that if you want to match on, say, age, you have to break it up into categories (say, under 18, 18-29, 30-39, etc. etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "(NOTE: As of 2024, their documentation site is weird: click the dropdowns next to headings to see the content, otherwise the documentation looks deserted)\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, one cannot always find exact matches on all variables, so what DAME does is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find all observations that match on *all* matching variables. \n",
    "2. Figure out which matching variable is least useful in predicting the outcome of interest $Y$ and drops that, then tries to match the remaining observations on the narrowed set of matching variables. \n",
    "3. This repeats until you run out of variables, all observations are matched, or you hit a stopping run (namely: quality of matches falls below a threshold). \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the lab has also created FLAME, which does the same thing, but employs some tricks to make it *massively* more computationally efficient, meaning it can be used on datasets with millions of observations (which most matching algorithms cannot). It's a little less accurate, but an amazing contribution never the less. "

    "The next step is to think about which of the matches that DAME generated are good enough for inclusion in our analysis. As you may recall, one of the choices you have to make as a researcher when doing matching is how \"good\" a match has to be in order to be included in your final data set. By default, DAME will keep dropping matching variables until it has been able to match all the treated observations or runs out of variables. It will do this no matter how bad the matches start to become -- if it ends up with the treated observation and a control observation that can only be matched on gender, it will match them just on gender, even though we probably don't think that that's a \"good\" match.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way to control this behavior is to tell DAME when to stop manually using the `early_stop_iterations` argument to tell the matching algorithm when to stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when is a good time to stop? There's no objective or \"right\" answer to that question. It fundamentally comes down to a trade-off between bias (which gets higher is you allow more low quality matches into your data) and variance (which will go down as you increase the number of matches you keep).\n",
    "\n",
    "But one way to start the process of picking a cut point is to examine how the quality of matches evolves over iterations. DAME keeps this information in `model.pe_each_iter`. This shows, for each iteration, the \"prediction error\" resulting from dropping the variables excluded in each step. This \"prediction error\" is the difference in the mean-squared error of regressing $Y$ on our matching variables (by default in a ridge regression) with all variables versus with the subset being used for matching in a given iteration. By design, of course, this is always increasing. \n",
    "\n",
    "To see how this evolves, plot your `pe` against iteration numbers. You can also see the `pe` values for each iteration reported in the output from when DAME ran above if you want to make your you're lining up the errors with iterations right. \n",
    "\n",
    "Are there any points where the match quality seems to fall off dramatically? "

    "OK, hopefully this gives you a taste of matching! There are, of course, *many* other permutations to be aware of though. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Matching with replacement.  In this exercise, we set `repeat=False`, so each observation could only end up in our final dataset once. However, if we use `repeat=True`, if an untreated observation is the closest observation to multiple treated observations, it may get put in the dataset multiple times. We can still use this dataset in *almost* the same way, though, except we have to make use of weights so that if an observation appears, say, twice, each observation has a weight that's 1/2 the weight of an observation only appearing once. \n",
    "- Matching with continuous variables: DAME is used for exact matching, but if you have lots of continuous variables, you can also match on those. In fact, the Almost Exact Matching Lab also has a library called [MALTS](https://almost-matching-exactly.github.io/MALTS/) that will do matching with continuous variables. That package does something *like* Mahalanobis Distance matching, but ulike Mahalanobis, which calculates the distance between observations in terms of the difference in all the matching variables normalized by each matching variable's standard deviation, MALTS does something much more clever. (Here's [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07415) describing the technique if you want all the details). Basically, it figures out how well each matching variable predicts our outcome $Y$, then weights the different variables by their predictive power instead of just normalizing by something arbitrary like their standard deviation. As a result, final matches will prioritize matching more closely on variables that are outcome-relevant. In addition, when it sees a categorical variable, it recognizes that and only pairs observations when they are an exact match on that categorical variable. \n",
    "- If you're dataset is huge, use `FLAME`: this dataset is small, but if you have lots of observations and lots of matching variable, the computational complexity of this task explodes, so the AEML created FLAME, which works with millions of observations at only a small cost to match quality. "
